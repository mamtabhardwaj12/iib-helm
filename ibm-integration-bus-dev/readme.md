IBMÂ® Integration Bus is a market-leading lightweight enterprise integration engine that offers a fast, simple way for systems and applications to communicate with each other. As a result, it can help you achieve business value, reduce IT complexity and save money. IBM Integration Bus supports a range of integration choices, skills and interfaces to optimize the value of existing technology investments. 

# Introduction

This chart deploys a single IBM Integration Bus for Developers integration node, containing a single integration server into an IBM Cloud Private or other Kubernetes environment.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `foo`:

```bash
helm install --name foo ibm-integration-bus-dev --set license=accept
```

This command accepts the [IBM Integration Bus for Developers license](LICENSE) and deploys an IBM Integration Bus for Developers server on the Kubernetes cluster. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: See all the resources deployed by the chart using `kubectl get all -l release=foo`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `foo` release:

```bash
helm delete foo
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart.

## Configuration
The following table lists the configurable parameters of the `ibm-mqadvanced-server-dev` chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)
